# trusted-types-bsc-thesis
A repository containing my BSc thesis, as well as most of the code I wrote for it.

The `testapp` directory contains a simple Django Web application that shows off the basic features of the SanitizerLibrary.

The `scripts` folder contains much of the source code of the infrastructure I built for my thesis, where the subdirectories contain the config generators, the config enforcer and the analysis scripts as described in the thesis.
